# Data Honor


- ðŸ”­ I majored in statistics in both undergraduate and graduate studies,
and I am also interested in data mining/machine learning.
Now I'm a machine learning engineer aiming to solve real world problems.


- ðŸ”­ I used to work on algorithm research related to network security at
[Tencent](https://github.com/Tencent),
mainly focusing on anomaly detection algorithms based on association analysis
and subspace clustering, with the application direction being anti-robot.
I am very happy that our algorithm is effective and has intercepted many attacks.
I am also very grateful to my leader Mr. Liao,
whose years of experience in the security field have greatly helped me in my work.

- ðŸ”­ Later, I went to [ByteDance](https://github.com/bytedance)
and worked on algorithm research and deployment in the AIOps field.
The main research directions were time series forcast/anomaly detection, root cause analysis, etc.,
with the main goal being to detect system failures in advance
and locate the root cause timely to reduce MTTR (Mean time to repair)
based on Metrics, Log, and Trace.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on my toys:[ToyData: Data Structures from Scratch](https://datahonor.com/toydata/),
[ToyML: Machine Learning from Scratch](https://datahonor.com/toyml/),
[ToyDL: Deep Learning from Scratch ](https://datahonor.com/toydl/)
